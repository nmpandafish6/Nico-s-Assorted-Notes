1. Theory Talks
2. 2 Groups, one for learning Java, one for robot code thing
3. after java group has basic understanding and is ready to write code, merge groups
4. robot code group works on pain train and cots, maybe baemax during that time
5. when groups merge, do a mini season?
	Mini season:
		4-6 weeks with 1 robot (probably baemax or baemax v2)
		MUSTS:
			Program a working drive (either mechanum or fc)
			Program a working artic (May be open looped, preferably close looped)
